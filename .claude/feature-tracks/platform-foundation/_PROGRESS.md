# platform-foundation — Progress Log

Append-only. One entry per completed step: timestamp, what changed, anything worth keeping.

Track goal: close the architecture questions `PROJECT_MAIN.md` §44 deliberately left open,
then build the platform every later track assumes — identity, the real data model, a versioned
API with a generated shared schema, the entitlement seam, media addressing, and a release
pipeline for all three artifacts.

**10 steps, and deliberately front-loaded.** This track delivers no user-visible value. It
exists because a native app cannot be force-updated, so API versioning, the shared contract,
and the entitlement seam get permanently more expensive after the first store release. See
`docs/DECISIONS.md` D3 for the review that shaped it.

**Starting position (2026-08-08):** a proof-of-concept analyzer + desktop web player running
against local Docker Postgres and a single seeded admin user, with media on local disk. See
[`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`](../../../docs/CURRENT-STATE.md) for what that includes and
[`docs/PRODUCT-COVERAGE.md`](../../../docs/PRODUCT-COVERAGE.md) for the gap this track starts
closing.
