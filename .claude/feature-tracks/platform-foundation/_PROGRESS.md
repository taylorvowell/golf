# platform-foundation — Progress Log

Append-only. One entry per completed step: timestamp, what changed, anything worth keeping.

Track goal: close the architecture questions `PROJECT_MAIN.md` §44 deliberately left open,
then build the platform every later track assumes — identity, the real data model, a versioned
API with a generated shared schema, the entitlement seam, media addressing, and a release
pipeline for all three artifacts.

**10 steps, and deliberately front-loaded.** This track delivers no user-visible value. It
exists because a native app cannot be force-updated, so API versioning, the shared contract,
and the entitlement seam get permanently more expensive after the first store release. See
`docs/DECISIONS.md` D3 for the review that shaped it.

**Starting position (2026-08-08):** a proof-of-concept analyzer + desktop web player running
against local Docker Postgres and a single seeded admin user, with media on local disk. See
[`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`](../../../docs/CURRENT-STATE.md) for what that includes and
[`docs/PRODUCT-COVERAGE.md`](../../../docs/PRODUCT-COVERAGE.md) for the gap this track starts
closing.

## 01 — Architecture Decisions ✅ 2026-08-08

Closed the questions `PROJECT_MAIN.md` §44 left open. **13 decisions recorded as D5–D17** in
`docs/DECISIONS.md`, synthesised into a new `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.

**The decision that turned out to be forced rather than chosen:** the only dev machine is
Windows with no Xcode, verified this session. iOS binaries cannot be built locally under *any*
framework, so a cloud build service is mandatory rather than a convenience. That, plus the fact
that the rendering rules worth keeping (`usePlayer.ts`, `traceSmoothing.ts`, `overlays.ts`,
`skeleton.ts`, `angleOverlay.ts`) are already TypeScript, settled the client on **React Native
via Expo with EAS Build** — Flutter would discard all of it and still not solve the build
problem.

Research done ahead of the step and recorded in the step file: VisionCamera covers 30–240 fps
capture on both platforms; frame-exact seeking is reachable on both, and Stage 0's existing
GOP of 10 — chosen originally for browser scrubbing — bounds ExoPlayer's decode-and-skip to
≤9 frames. **The unresolved risk is the Android per-frame overlay callback**, which iOS has a
clean analogue for and Android does not confirm. Step 02 now leads with proving it on Android,
and D5 is explicitly provisional until it does.

Other notable calls: the Next.js app becomes the coach/admin surface rather than being retired
(D6), so the existing player keeps a production home. §39's Azure preference is deliberately
**not** followed for media (D8) — splitting storage from the auth system would create a second
authorization path for user video — with a revisit trigger recorded. SLO targets are numeric
(D13), and the analysis p95 target is openly **not yet known to be achievable**: a 520-frame
fixture takes ~5.5 min on this machine, and `analyzer-service` must measure the hosted worker
and revise rather than quietly miss it.

Verification: `services/analyzer/swingsage` untouched (a DoD requirement — a decisions step
that edits the pipeline has the boundary wrong), `tsc --noEmit` clean, `eslint` clean,
pytest green.

Next: **02 — Mobile Client Spike and Workspace**, running Android-first.
